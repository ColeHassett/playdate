## Running Locally

Right now to run the application you can use docker. To just use docker do the following

```shell
docker build -t playdate .
docker run --rm playdate
```

You can also use docker-compose instead which will be useful once the postgres connection is required when running locally

```shell
docker-compose up
```
OR
If you are unfornately using the plugin version :painchamp:
```shell
docker compose up
```
