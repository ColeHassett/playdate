## Dependencies
* go
* docker or podman
* equivalent compose runner
* _optional_: [just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

## Running Locally

Copy the `.env` file and replace the environment variables with new defaults or just keep the defaults

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

To run locally start using the provider docker compose
```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

The http server will be available at `localhost:8080`.

And thats it! Now you can change files locally and your go http server will live reload based on them without having to restart your docker compose command or rebuilding your entire docker image.

**Note** if you are lazy like you can use just instead of all of that typing
```shell
just
```
